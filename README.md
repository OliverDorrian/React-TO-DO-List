#  ⚛️ React based To-Do List  ⚛️
This project was my first React based work, I wanted to create a method of storing entered user content, then displaying it into a To-Do list. Alongside this, this project improved by design work; firstly, by creating a method of generating a 'frosted glass' effect on div backgrounds; secondly, by using keyframes to make the page seem constant and fluid.
#  📚 Key Things I Learnt 📚
* How to Define Functions and Compontents.
* How Data is Transfered Between Compontents.
* How Elements Render from the Root.
# 🆕 Possible Additional Features 🆕
- Some Level of Data Storage for Revisting Users
- More Information About Each Task
- Light Mode
# ✔️ To-Do Main Page ✔️
